// Rock Paper Scissors
//      In this program I will be creating an interactive program to play Rock,Paper,Scissors. The program will as the player how 
// many games they would like to play then start the game. The program will randomly sellect either rock paper or scissors, 
// if the selection the uer inputs beats the compuers selection then the computer will award the user a point, if not the program 
// will give itself a point. This process will repeat itself until either the program or the player wins the majority of the games. 
// Or if the player wants to play an even number of rounds then the game will continue until all the games have been played and 
// choose a winner based on who has the highest score. Considering there is a winner and the game didnt end in a tie.
