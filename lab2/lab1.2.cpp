/* program chooses a random number "x" between 1 and 10.
  player must then guess a number "y" in an attempt to make "y=x"
  if "yâ‰ x", then the program will tell the player they were wrong and will lose 1 point of a possible 10
  if "y<x", then the program will tell the player to guess higher
  if "y>x", then the program will tell the player to guess lower
  this process will repeat until the player guesses the correct number "y" so that "y=x"
  if the player chooses the correct number "y", then the plyer will recieve "10-z" points
  the varible "z" represents the number of times the player guessed incorrectly */
